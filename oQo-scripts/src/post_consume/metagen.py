Quantum computers will do extraordinary things. They will create extremely complex digital twins at the molecular level and develop optimization solutions at the global level, allowing us to reshape whole industries, from pharmaceuticals to logistics.

But before we can see any of those benefits, we need a viable quantum computer that can solve hypercomplex problems. The quantum computers we have today can solve problems, but nothing an ordinary computer canâ€™t handle. 

To take the next big leap in quantum computing, we need a stable qubit.

A qubit, or quantum bit, is the most fundamental building block of a quantum computer. It functions much like a transistor on a standard computer chip, but it can calculate in ways no traditional microprocessor ever could. Building a useful quantum computer would require entangling thousands of these qubits.
The problem is qubits are inherently unstable. The most infinitesimal shift in temperature, structure, or electromagnetic field can destabilize a qubit, turning any information it contains into useless noise. The life of most qubits today can be measured in mere milliseconds. 

Nokia Bell Labs, however, is researching a new type of qubit that is extremely stable. Called a topological qubit, it is much more resilient to external stimuli, allowing it to remain viable for a period of hours, if not days or weeks. This topological approach to quantum computing could be revolutionary, drastically reducing the size and cost of future quantum computers, as well as the resources necessary to maintain it.
